    <h2 style="text-align:left">History of C:</h2>
    <p><h3> After the innovation of computers many programming languages were developed.But they were not powerfull and there were'nt general purpose language , for instance FORTRAN is used for scientific computations ans COBOL is used for business applications.</h3></p>
    <p> <h3>Dennis Ritchie and his crew at AT&T Laboratories worked on this problem and created a multipurpose language called 'C' which is named after its predecessor A and B. The C Language is regarded as the mother of all programming language. C has faster execution speeds due to its simplicity and hardware interface, still C is used for basic hardware interactions in modern computers.</h3> </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Advantages of C Language:</h2>
    <ul>
      <h3><li>Faster Execution speed</li>
      <li>Robust</li>
      <li>Easy to learn</li>
      <li>Great Hardware interface</li></h3>
    </ul>
    <h2>The C Language family:</h2>
      <p> <h3>The C has advanced over years and subsequent versions were released. The C has many versions such as C89 and C99.The C language is Structural languag (i.e its not object oriented language), which is one of its disadvantage. Hence Bjarne Stroustrup and his team added OOP feature to C language and called it as C++ .After more year the Microsoft took the C++ added some features from popular programming languages such as Java and Python and named it as C#(pronounced as C sharp). </h3> </p>
      <h2>An Example of C program is shown below</h2>
